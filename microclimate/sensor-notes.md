Trip to Chisos. Sensors downloaded and reset by Erik Lindberg and Xiulin Gao. Notes:

- PI514 humidity sensor is broken.  We left it there.
- PI516 Temperature sensor fell down, replace with new one.
- Could not find sensor for ET518.  Replaced sensor with new ibutton, DS1922L.
- Could not find sensor for BC519.  Replaced sensor with new ibutton, DS2422.
- BC521 was taking both temperature and humidity, then we start a new mission just for humidity and set up a new sensorBC520 for temperature.
- SR523 had the ibutton fall down.  We jb welded it back on.
