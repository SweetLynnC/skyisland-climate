Notes regarding each sensor trip.

## CM trip 2015-01-30 to 2015-02-01 ##

Trip to Chisos. Sensors downloaded and reset by Erik Lindberg and Xiulin Gao. Notes:

- PI514 humidity sensor is broken.  We left it there.
- PI516 Temperature sensor fell down, replace with new one. 2015-03-16: Split at 7-1-14 looks like when it fell.
- Could not find sensor for ET518.  Replaced sensor with new ibutton, DS1922L.
- Could not find sensor for BC519.  Replaced sensor with new ibutton, DS2422.
- BC521 was taking both temperature and humidity, then we start a new mission just for humidity and set up a new sensorBC520 for temperature.
- SR523 had the ibutton fall down.  We jb welded it back on. Split into GROUND version at 5-23-14


## GM trip 2015-03-14 to 2015-03-15 ##

Trip to GM front country only.  Dylan Schwilk
Gaudalupe Peak Trail, Smith Spring trail and McKittrick Canyon trail. These were all set at 4000s interval, so they will expire 3/25/2016.

1. MC 607 (T) was on the ground and no data can be trusted as air temp. It
has been uploaded as MC607-GROUND.csv
2. GP611 (H) and GP612 (T) were on the ground in the funnels. The whole
branch fell? They were still shielded, but we should check the data to
see when they fell.  2015-03-16: Looks like Nov 1 is good cut.
3. The following sensors were replaced: SP601, SP603, MC604, MC605,
MC607, MC607. All due to epoxy starting to fail. There was no trouble
with data downloads.

## GM Front country trip 2016-07-14 ##

1. GP609: ibutton fell off hardware cloth was on ground. Data Looks OK through end of data, however.
2. GP 611 and 612: radaiton shilds with ibuttons were on ground.  Looks like it happened in late fall.  Last good data appears to be 11/15/2015. Data cleaned and raw dta saved as GP612.raw
3. GP 611 or 612 Humidity could not read mission.
