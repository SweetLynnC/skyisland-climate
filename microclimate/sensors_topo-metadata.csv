variable,type,units,description
sensor,string,,iButton sensor ID see sensors.csv
elev,numeric,,elevation in meters
specific_catchment area,numeric,,"flow accumulation grid or. contributing area to at a location using  the D8 (O'Callaghan and Mark, 1984) algorithm"
slope,numeric,,slope in degrees
relelev_z,numeric,,relative z position channel to divide 
relelev_l,numeric,,relative l position channel to divide:  dist to ridge â€“ distance to valley so negative values mean that the point is closer to valley than to ridge
ldist_tovalley,numeric,,l distance to valley
ruggedness,numeric,,"root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) for each grid cell), calculating the residuals (i.e. elevation differences) between a grid cell and its eight neighbours"
ldist_ridge,,,l distance to ridge
zdist_valley,numeric,,z distance to valley
radiation,numeric,,total annual solar radiation (ESRI 2014)
MSD,numeric,,multi-scale dissection index: relative landscape position of a location across a range of spatial scales (Evans 1972)
relelev_watershed_minmax,numeric,,elevation relative to rwatershed min/max at the hydrologic unit code 12 level
wetness index (WI),numeric,,Propensity for a site to be saturated to the surface given its contributing area and local slope characteristics. It is calculated as:
,,,WI = Ln(As / tan(Slope))
,,,Where As is the specific catchment area (i.e. the upslope contributing area per unit contour length)
