Notes on iButton climate sensors

1. Data storage capacity of iBUttons
   
   - each sensor can hold 8160 logs  [Check: 8192 logs]
   - 15 minutes = 85 days
   - 30 minutes = 170 days
   - 40 minutes = 226 days
   - 42 minutes = 240 days
   - 45 minutes = 255 days

   REMINDER: Times in the program are in seconds. So, 45 mins = 2700 secs.

2. Raw data storage:  raw csv files go in raw-ibutton/ directory tree 
   Organized by mtn range, then T or H, then date in yymmdd format.
   The actual files are named be sensor name.  The pythons script
   merges by appending the separate dated downloads into a similar
   directory structure under "merged-ibutton", but lacking the
   directories named by date.


3. The coordinates, notes and other data (such as gravimetric soil
   water)  associated with each sensor    are stored in
   "SensorMaster.csv".  The file "sensors-to-upload.csv" is a paired
   down version of this master file with only lat, lon, elev, and
   sensor name.  Tis file is in a formrat suitable for uploading to a
   gps using gpsbabel and the unicsv format
